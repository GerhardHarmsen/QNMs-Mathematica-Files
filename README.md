Mathematica Notebooks for Quasi-normal mode research

Repository for the notebooks used to solve for the QNMs of spin-3/2 fields in various black hole backgrounds. 

The AIM method is used from the paper "A New Approach to Black Hole Quasinormal Modes: A Review of the Asymptotic Iteration Method"

The WKB method is adapted from Roman Konoplyas work on solving for QNMs "Quasinormal behavior of the D-dimensional Schwarzshild black hole and higher order WKB
approach"
